RainFramework divide logic by presentation, with the following MVC structure:

               
                                 MODELS
                                    ^
user                                |
input    >     LOADER  ---->   CONTROLLERS ----> VIEWS

             
- LOADER, get the input, init everything, load the controller and draw the output.
- CONTROLLERS, are the principal components (eg News), they load Models to retrieve data and than draw with the views.
- MODELS, get the information from database.
- VIEWS, are HTML templates, loaded with RainTPL.
